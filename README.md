### Bio:
I studied at the University of California, Riverside where I received my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Engineering.  While working toward's my undergraduate degree, I worked in the University's Embedded Systems Lab as an undergraduate researcher.  Here I collaborated with other engineers in a Microfluidics research project, which would eventually get published.  After graduating, I began working in the Aerospace Industry as a software application engineer and eventually as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer.  Through my past school and professional experiences, I've realized my passion is Embedded Systems.  I plan on getting back into a technical position where I can use the design and implemantation skills we learn in the WES program.
